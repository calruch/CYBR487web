# Network Scanner

A command-line network scanning tool that can:

- Discover hosts using **ARP** or **ICMP**
- Perform basic **OS fingerprinting** (IPID behavior via ICMP)
- Scan **TCP ports** using **SYN** probes
- Run **traceroute** via ICMP or TCP
- Perform a local **Self Scan** (processes with listening sockets, via `/proc`)

Use the **Quick Start** to run your first scan, then use the **User Guide** for details on scan types and flags.

> This site documents the current behavior of the code in `src/` and the run scripts in the repo root.
