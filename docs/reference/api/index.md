# API reference

The API reference pages in this section are generated automatically from `src/` during the MkDocs build.

If you don’t see modules listed here:

1. Confirm your project code lives in `src/`
2. Confirm `src` is importable (recommended: include `src/__init__.py`)
3. See **Development → Docs maintenance**
