# Network Analyzer Documentation

Welcome to the **CYBR487 Project 1 — Network Analyzer** documentation site.

This tool is a **Linux-first** network analysis utility built for a CYBR487 class project. It supports:

- **Host discovery** (ARP-based and ICMP-based approaches)
- **TCP SYN port scanning**
- **Traceroute** (ICMP and TCP variants)
- **Self Scan**: inspect *local* listening sockets (similar in spirit to `netstat -tuln`)

!!! warning "Authorization required"
    Only scan networks you own or have explicit permission to test.

## Where to start

- **Quick Start** → see the fastest path to a successful scan.
- **Tutorials** → step-by-step walkthroughs.
- **Reference** → CLI and output formats.
- **Explanation** → how the internals work, design decisions, and limitations.
