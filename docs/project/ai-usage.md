# AI Assistance Log

This repository keeps a lightweight log of notable work that involved AI assistance. The goal is transparency:
record *what* was assisted and *where* it impacted the repository, without embedding long transcripts into the main docs.

The site-rendered ledger data lives in `ai-ledger.js`.
